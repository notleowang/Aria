# Milestone 4
Below is the documentation for our `README.md` submission for Milestone 4.

## User-game interactions
### Changes implemented + rationale
**Observation**: Users found it difficult to remember which power-ups were currently active and there was no visual indicator at all for “increase damage” power-ups.\
**Change**: Added visual indicator icons for the active power-ups to the element selection display

**Observation**: The information about which enemies are weak to which element was not something our users were able to intuitively guess. 
The fact that enemies are healed by their own element was often overlooked.\
**Change**: Added new tutorial level with description of the weaknesses and an infographic showing which element to use on which. It also includes 4 enemies on which to test the elemental projectiles on such that the user can see the differences in damage dealt and enemies healing.

**Observation**: Some users felt that using 1,2,3,4 as hotkeys to change the player’s attack element was sometimes awkward as they use the same hand to move the player using WASD.\
**Change**: In addition to the 1,2,3,4 hotkeys, we provide two additional means of changing the attack element: scroll wheel will cycle through the elements and right-click will increment the player’s current attack element.

**Observation**: Player health and mana bars cluttered the screen.\
**Change**: Moved the player health and mana bars to the top-left hand corner so as not to obscure the action in the middle of the screen.

**Observation**:  Boss health bar often off-screen because of the size of the boss room.\
**Change**: Moved boss health bar to bottom center screen so as to always be visible.

**Observation**: If a user needed to step away from the game mid-level, there was no option to pause.\
**Change**: Added pause menu (ESC)

**Observation**:  To restart the game, it was necessary to kill the program and completely restart it in Visual Studio.\
**Change**: Added pause menu (bound to ESC key) which allows user to exit to the main menu and click “Start Game” for a fresh restart

**Observation**:  Exiting the program was previously bound to “backspace” key, which felt inelegant and was not obvious.\
**Change**: Added pause menu which allows user to exit to the main menu and click “Quit Game” to stop the program.

**Observation**: Gloomy lighting effect caused visibility issues during gameplay. It was difficult to see enemies on the edges of the screen and overall too dim to be visually appealing.\
**Change**: Increased the radius of visibility on the lighting effect.

**Observation**: No indicator to the player once they have killed the last enemy that the exit door has now appeared if they player isn’t in view of the door.\
**Change**: Added a sound effect when exit door appears

## Game balance
### Changes implemented + rationale
**Observation**: Triple-shot power-up was unanimously considered the most powerful power-up and dramatically decreased 
the time required to kill enemies relative to the other power-ups.\
**Change**: Decreased the damage dealt by one projectile from a triple-shot to 40%. 40% was chosen after play-testing other values.

**Observation**: The current levels we had were a bit too monotonous and since the layout was quite similar, this made the gameplay straightforward and thus quite easy.\
**Change**: We added new and revamped old levels so that it became a bit harder. We also have a logical ordering of levels in terms of difficulty so that as the player progresses through the game, it becomes a bit more difficult.

**Observation**: Boss fights were quite unbalanced in our previous version of the game. 
Their health values were quite low which made fighting the boss not really feel like fighting a boss. In addition to this, the boss AI was too easy (similar to small enemies).\
**Change**: We increased the amount of health the bosses had and we also made bosses have different ai than smaller enemies by implementing attack patterns.

**Observation**: We noticed that players would sometimes die during a level as enemies slowly dwindled down the player’s health and players had no form of gaining back health.\
**Change**: We implemented health packs throughout some difficult levels so the player can be more successful in completing the level.

**Observation**: User's had too much difficulty hitting enemies
**Change**: Enemies' speed was reduced when they were dodging the player's projectiles. Change made in [this commit](https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/CPSC427-2023W-T1/Team06Aria/commit/3b575567193e4f74545f4c330c49f724153f0bf8#diff-3000781566c743b7082cc7fb39eb123341cd39ad26b73ead94f7c4e0c5623335R57), which reduced the speed from 350 to 300. Initially the speed was set to 200, then I discovered that the enemies were too easy, so I adjusted it to 350. Then the enemies were too frustrating to beat as they dodged too quickly, so I reduced it to 300. 

**Observation**: Projectiles shot by the bosses were very fast and thus difficult to dodge at full speed.
**Change**: The speed of the projectiles shot by the bosses had to be decreased. It was set to 0.4x the normal speed initially, then I updated it to 0.5x the normal speed in [this commit](https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/CPSC427-2023W-T1/Team06Aria/commit/a198d13eea120e3f4007b7cf36be950903ad1cc50), as I experienced a loss of the game's momentum at 0.4x speed (i.e. it felt boring).

**Observation**: Boss health at the end of M3 was too low for an interesting battle.
**Change**: A lot of adjustments were made for the amount that the bosses heal. I originally envisioned players being able to kill a boss with no power ups after one cycle of the bosses' phases. I did not want players to be able to easily kill the bosses before the first cycle is over, so that they can experience all the attacking patterns the bosses have. However, the player must also be able to do net damage each cycle, otherwise the bosses are simply not beatable. I eventually arrived at a sweet spot of healing 625 HP over 1250ms in [this commit](https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/CPSC427-2023W-T1/Team06Aria/commit/d89c36e2c21041abf3c8eba956afde08d7069f6d).

**Observation**: At the end of M3 bosses throw very few projectiles and they are very easy to dodge
**Change**: Now some phases require precise movement from the players to dodge the projectiles. I had to also adjust the width of the opening during some phases so that the players must navigate carefully (but should not take damage if they move correctly). In the phase where the bosses generate projectiles around the player, I had to try different values for the size of the opening and the speed at which the projectiles move, and eventually I arrived at a maximum velocity of 200 initially then slowing down to 150, in [this commit](https://github.students.cs.ubc.ca/CPSC427-2023W-T1/Team06Aria/commit/7bf22ea6eec6ac26eeedcdbadf018feaff0d3164).

**Observation**: With new boss attack patterns, player position is very restricted and when bosses can dodge projectiles the player is very unlikely to hit their target.
**Change**: Boss movement was made simpler - and the bosses will never chase the players either.
